2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?

3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and
'cat' in spam.keys()?
Ans: if 'cat' is a key in spam, then 'cat' in spam gives true.
     if 'cat' is a value in spam, then 'cat' in spam gives false.
     
     if 'cat' is key in spam, the 'cat' in spam.keys() gives true.
     if 'cat' is value in spam, the 'cat' in spam.keys() gives false.
     
     So, 'cat' in spam is basically searching only the keys values.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and
'cat' in spam.values()?
Ans: if 'cat' is a key in spam, then 'cat' in spam gives true.
     if 'cat' is a value in spam, then 'cat' in spam gives false.

     if 'cat' is key in spam, the 'cat' in spam.values() gives false.
     if 'cat' is value in spam, the 'cat' in spam.values() gives true.
     
     So, if we not specify keys() or values() to spam then it searching only keys and gives the result.
