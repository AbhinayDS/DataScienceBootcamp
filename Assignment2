1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: True and False, T and F

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: and, or and not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans: AND - T T - T
           T F - F
           F F - F
           F T - F
     OR  - T T - T
           T F - T
           F F - F
           F T - T
     NOT - T - F
           F - T

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) ---- F
not (5 > 4) ---- F
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ---- T
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ---- F
(True and True) and (True == False) ---- F
(not False) or (not True) ---- T

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans: >,<,==,!=,>=,<=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans: equal to is used to compare to values and which returns a boolean value but assignment operators
are to assign data into a variable.
equal to is double '=', ==
assignment operator is single '=', =

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Ans: ham
     spam
     spam

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
if spam ==1:
    print ("Hello")
elif spam ==2:
    print ("Howdy")
else :
    print ("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans: 

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans: break key word is used to comeout from a loop or stop looping, continue will end current itreation and go to the starting of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: range(10) and range(0,10) are same which gives the range of 0 to 10, where 10 is not considered.
range(0, 10, 1) is the range of 0 to 10 with the jump of 1 count in positive direction.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans- for i in range(0,10):
         print(i+1)
     
     i=0
     while i < 10:
         print(i+1)
         i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
